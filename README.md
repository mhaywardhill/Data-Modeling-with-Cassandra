# Data-Modeling-with-Cassandra

Sparkify collects songs and user activity on their music streaming app. The analytics team wants to know what songs users are listening to. The data resides in a folder (event_data) of CSV files on user activity on the app.

In this project, we create a Keyspace and tables in Apache Cassandra and build an ETL pipeline using Python, to answer three specific user questions.
